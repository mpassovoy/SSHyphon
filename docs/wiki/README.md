# SSHyphon Wiki

This wiki provides a starting structure for SSHyphon documentation, focused on quick setup, common workflows, and references for operating the containerized SFTP sync UI.

## Pages
- [Getting started](getting-started.md) – compose/deployment basics, first login, and adding storage mounts.
- [Syncing & Jellyfin tasks](syncing-and-jellyfin.md) – configuring sync jobs, enabling scheduling, and orchestrating Jellyfin tasks alongside transfers.
- [Logs, backups, and recovery](operations.md) – where data lives, how to export logs, and how to reset configs safely.
- [Automated tests](automated-tests.md) – quick reference for backend and frontend test coverage.
- [API reference](api-reference.md) – complete list of backend endpoints, methods, and payload expectations.
